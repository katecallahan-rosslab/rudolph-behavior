this repository contains .stl files of different dividers and a lid for 3 chamber and light/dark behavior boxes for mice. please see the Wiki for 2D images of the designs with measurements as well as close up clarifications of smaller parts of the designs.
these dividers are compatible with the collapsible acrylic open field box design in the repository "open-field".
a 3 chamber box can be constructed by placing 2 pieces of the file "steph_3chamber.stl" in opposite directions inside the acrylic box such that it is split into 3 equally sized chambers with doorways on opposite sides of the box.
a light dark chamber with a doorway may be constructed by placing 1 piece of the file "steph_lightdark" in the center of the acrylic box, and placing 1 piece of the file "steph_lightdark_lid" on top of the half of the box to be designated as the dark chamber.
