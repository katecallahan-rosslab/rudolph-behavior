this repository contains .stl files of different dividers and a lid for 3 chamber and light/dark behavior boxes for mice. included are images of the 2D designs with measurements as well as close up clarifications of smaller parts of the designs.
these dividers are compatible with the collapsible acrylic open field box design in the repository "open-field".
a 3 chamber box can be constructed by placing 2 pieces of the file "steph_3chamber.stl" in opposite directions inside the acrylic box such that it is split into 3 equally sized chambers with doorways on opposite sides of the box.
